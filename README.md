This project dealt with the creation of a Python program called "GifGram" which the user can launch to find gifs and modify them. When the user launches the program, the search window comes up. The user can enter a search term, and click the search button. The Giphy API is implemented in the program, and it is used to return gifs related to the search term. After the gifs are returned, they are displayed in a new window. The user can choose which gif they want to modify, and after they click on the Modify button, a new window pops up with the gif displayed in full size, and some options to modify the gif. The user can filter the gif, and add text to the top and the bottom of the gif. After the modification is done, the finished gif is automatically saved in the project folder.

To run the program, just enter "py main.py" in PowerShell when in the project folder.

Future work: Potential additions to the program could be adding a feature to share the gifs on Twitter or Facebook using the respective APIs. Also, we could make a chat application where users can communicate with gifs. Additionally, the program could have a feature so that the user can record a few minutes of video using their webcam and convert this to a gif (i.e. making a gif).
